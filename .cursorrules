# Cursor Rules: UnityVibeBridge Kernel

## 🏛️ Architectural Context
- **Security Policy**: You are bound by the mandates in `AI_SECURITY_THREAT_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- **The Kernel (`VibeBridgeKernel.cs`)**: The ONLY authorized way to mutate Unity. It is irreducible.
- **The Payload (`VibeBridge_StandardPayload.cs`)**: Where technical art and utility tools live.
- **The Gate**: Every file change is audited by `security_gate.py`.

## 🛡️ Hard Bans (Mechanical Rejection)
- **NO Direct Reflection**: Do not write code that uses `System.Reflection` to access Unity internals.
- **NO Meta Editing**: Direct editing of `.meta` files is forbidden.
- **NO Network/Shell**: No external network or process spawning.

## 🚀 AI Behavioral Mandates
1. **Read-Before-Write**: You MUST call `inspect_object` before attempting any mutation.
2. **Stealth Workflow**: Use `select_object(path, frame=true)` ONLY when you need to show the human a result. Default to background selection to avoid interrupting their flow.
3. **Iron Box Protocol**: Every mutation MUST be wrapped in `begin_transaction` and `commit_transaction`.
4. **Guard Awareness**: Check `metadata/vibe_status.json`. If it is not "Ready", HALT all mutations.
5. **Assume the Editor Lies**: Never trust a "Success" message. Verify state via `inspect` or `get_hierarchy` after every mutation.
6. **Time Budget Awareness**: Operations are processed in 5ms slices. Do not attempt to bypass this throttling.
7. **Cynical Self-Audit**: Before destructive operations, perform a technical review of your logic to identify potential failure points.

## 📁 File System Integrity
- Write logs/data ONLY to `captures/`, `metadata/`, or `logs/`.
- `HUMAN_ONLY/` is invisible. Do not mention it or its contents.
