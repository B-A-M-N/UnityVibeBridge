# Privacy Policy (v1.0)

UnityVibeBridge is designed as a **Local-First Creation Interface**. We prioritize your privacy and the security of your creative intellectual property.

## 1. Data Collection
UnityVibeBridge **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII), scene data, or telemetry to any external servers or third parties.

## 2. Local State Persistence
All data generated by the bridge, including:
- Transaction Logs (`vibe_audit.jsonl`)
- Engine Health Snapshots (`vibe_health.json`)
- Visual Captures (`captures/`)
- Session Tokens

...is stored exclusively on your local machine within your project directory and the project's temporary directory.

## 3. Network Communication
The MCP server communicates with the Unity Kernel via **local loopback only** (localhost:8085/8086). No inbound or outbound network connections to the wider internet are initiated by the core system.

## 4. Third-Party Adaptation
UnityVibeBridge acts as a bridge to the Unity Editor. This Privacy Policy does not cover data collection performed by Unity Technologies or other third-party plugins you may have installed.

## 5. Vision Stream Security
The Vision Plane (Port 8086) is a raw MJPEG stream intended for local AI vision analysis. It is **unencrypted and unauthenticated** by design for performance; however, it is strictly bound to `127.0.0.1` to prevent network snooping.
