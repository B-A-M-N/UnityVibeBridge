# UnityVibeBridge: Creative & Safety Context

## 🏛️ Security Constitution
- **Reference**: You are bound by `AI_SECURITY_THREAT_ACCEPTANCE.md`. 
- **Enforcement**: Your code is audited by `security_gate.py`.
- **Boundaries**: Do not attempt to bypass the Kernel or the Gate.

## 🛡️ Iron Box Protocol (MANDATORY)
- **Transactions**: All mutations MUST be wrapped in `begin_transaction` and `commit_transaction`. One request = One Undo step.
- **Dry-Runs**: Every change is validated against the **Kernel Guard** (No mutation during Compiling/PlayMode).
- **No Guesswork**: Use `inspect_object` first. If a target is missing, do not hallucinate its existence.

## 🚀 Execution Flow (The "Director" Workflow)
1. **Discover**: `get_hierarchy` -> Build scene map.
2. **Verify**: `inspect_object` -> Prove assumptions about components.
3. **Protect**: `begin_transaction` -> Safety net.
4. **Execute**: `rename`/`reparent`/`clone` -> Perform intent.
5. **Observe**: Check `_vibe_warning` in response for errors.
6. **Finalize**: `commit_transaction`.

## 🛡️ Cynical Self-Verification
Before executing any destructive mutation, perform a cynical technical validation:
*Identify 3 ways this could fail, crash Unity, or corrupt the Asset Database. Trust telemetry over verbal success.*

## 🎨 Optimization Targets
- **PC**: < 70k Polys, < 150MB VRAM.
- **Quest**: < 10k Polys (Very Poor) or 5k (Excellent).
- **Vision**: Use `select_object` to show the human what you are working on.

## 📁 Storage
- Outputs go to `captures/`, `metadata/`, or `optimizations/`.
- `HUMAN_ONLY/` is mechanically invisible to you. Do not touch.
