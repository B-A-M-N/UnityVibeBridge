# UnityVibeBridge: Creative & Safety Context
## 🛡️ Iron Box Protocol
- **Transactions**: All mutations are automatically wrapped in transactions. One request = One Undo step.
- **Dry-Runs**: Every change is validated against system safety rules before execution.
- **No Guesswork**: Use the Semantic Roles below to target objects. If a role is missing, use 'inspect_object' first, then 'log_semantic_discovery'.
